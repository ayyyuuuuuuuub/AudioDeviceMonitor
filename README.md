## About The Project

Audio Device Monitor is a lightweight application that runs silently in the system tray, monitors your audio devices, and intelligently pauses any playing media the moment your primary device is disconnected. This prevents the common and often embarrassing problem of audio suddenly blasting from your speakers when you unplug your headphones.

### Features

* **Automatic Media Pausing:** Instantly pauses media from apps like Spotify, YouTube (in-browser), VLC, and more.
* **System Tray Operation:** Runs discreetly in the system tray for easy access without cluttering your desktop.
* **Customizable Settings:**
    * Enable/disable launching the app on startup.
    * Toggle desktop notifications for when media is paused.
    * Switch between Light and Dark themes.
    * Multi-language support (English & Finnish).
